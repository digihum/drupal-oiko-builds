description: "<p>This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in the pure sense\r\nof physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile”\r\nobjects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can\r\nbe determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It\r\nmay be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or\r\nabsolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context\r\nof cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in\r\nposition in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which\r\nNelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of\r\nthis Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the\r\nvessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack\r\nhistorical and cultural relevance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees\r\nthe notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.</p>"

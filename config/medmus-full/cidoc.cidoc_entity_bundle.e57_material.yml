Discrete used or\r\nprocessed pieces, such as the stones from Nefer Titi's temple, should be modelled as parts (cf.\r\nP46 is composed of).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type is used categorically in the model without reference to instances of it, i.e. the Model\r\ndoes not foresee the description of instances of instances of E57 Material, e.g.: “instances of\r\ngold”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is recommended that internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminology are used.</p>"

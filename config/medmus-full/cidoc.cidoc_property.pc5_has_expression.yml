F1 Work, F2 Expression, F3 Manifestation in LRMoo guidelines)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A EC1 Work (or a EC6 Music) may have different expressions, as it can be realized in different versions and different translations.\r\nIn the present data model an expression is always a EC1 Work (or EC6 Music). The hierarchisation between work and its expression is defined by the \"PC5 has expression\" property rather than by different entities.\r\nTo specify that a EC1 Literary work is an expression, one may use P2 has type: E55 Type: Expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present data model does not strictly distinguish between Work – Expression – Manifestation, but links directly the EC1 Work (= F1 Work)  with “EC7 Source” (which corresponds to “Manifestation” as intended in LRMoo guidelines: e.g. a Physical Object – in case of of a Manuscript or a Symbolic Object when we talk about Prints, when we refer to the prototype that was used to create all copies [= Items] of a specific edition). This compromise is necessary to guarantee the simplicity of data input for this specific project.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Navigatio Sancti Brendani P5 has expression (is expression of): The Anglo-Norman version of the Voyage de Saint Brendan by Benedeit</li>\r\n<li>The legend of Tristan and Iseult P5 has expression: The Tristan by Beroul</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

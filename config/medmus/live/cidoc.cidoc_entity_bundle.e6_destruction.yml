description: "<p>This class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing such that\nthey lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.</p>\n\n<p>Some destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity.\nIntentional destruction may be documented by classifying the event as both an E6 Destruction\nand E7 Activity.</p>\n\n<p>The decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified is context sensitive:\n1. If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely\n   as E6 Destruction.\n2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the\n   destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or\n   material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is\n   preserved, but identity is not.\n3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the\n   event should be documented as E11 Modification.</p>\n"
examples: "<ul>\n<li>the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD</li>\n<li>the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7)</li>\n<li>the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog</li>\n</ul>\n"

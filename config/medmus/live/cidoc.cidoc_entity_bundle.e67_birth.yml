description: "<p>This class comprises the births of human beings. E67 Birth is a biological event focussing on\r\nthe context of people coming into life. (E63 Beginning of Existence comprises the coming into\r\nlife of any living beings).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twins, triplets etc. are brought into life by the same E67 Birth event. The introduction of the\r\nE67 Birth event as a documentation element allows the description of a range of family\r\nrelationships in a simple model. Suitable extensions may describe more details and the\r\ncomplexity of motherhood with the intervention of modern medicine. In this model, the\r\nbiological father is not seen as a necessary participant in the E67 Birth event.</p>"
examples: "<ul>\r\n<li>the birth of Alexander the Great</li>\r\n</ul>"
